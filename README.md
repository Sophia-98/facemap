# Face-Map

A React-based facial recognition application that harnesses AI-driven face recognition APIs to identify, and highlight faces in image submissions. It not only manages user authentication and registration but also prioritises security by encrypting user passwords.

Moreover, the application fetches data from a RESTful API using Knex and tracks user interactions, offering insights into the entries made by each user. 

## Technologies Used
- React
- Express.js
- Postman
- PostgreSQL
- Render
- APIs
